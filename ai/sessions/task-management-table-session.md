# Task Management Table Implementation Session - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive task table view for the household duties manager with filtering, search capabilities, and full mobile responsiveness. This session created a complete task management interface without edit/delete/add functionality as requested.

## Current Task from todos.md
