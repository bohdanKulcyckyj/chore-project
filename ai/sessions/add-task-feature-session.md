## Mobile-First Technical Requirements

### Mobile-Optimized Form Fields
- Task name (required) - Full-width input with large touch target
- Description (optional) - Expandable textarea
- Category selection (dropdown) - Touch-friendly native select or custom picker
- Assigned member (dropdown) - Large, scrollable picker

- Points/rewards - Large number input with clear labels
- Recurring options (optional) - Collapsible section

### Mobile UI Design Principles
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px height for all interactive elements
- **Full-Screen Modal**: On mobile, modal takes full viewport for better UX
- **Large Typography**: Readable text sizes (16px+ for inputs)
- **Thumb-Friendly**: Important actions within easy thumb reach
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced options in collapsible sections
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section breaks and spacing
- **Error Feedback**: Inline validation with clear mobile-friendly messages

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile (0-768px)**: Full-screen modal, stacked form layout
- **Tablet (768-1024px)**: Large modal with 2-column form sections
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Standard modal with optimized form layout

### Validation Rules (Mobile-Optimized)
- Real-time validation with immediate visual feedback
- Clear error messages positioned for mobile reading
- Prevent keyboard dismissal on validation errors

3. âœ… Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS utilities

## Mobile Testing Checklist âœ…
