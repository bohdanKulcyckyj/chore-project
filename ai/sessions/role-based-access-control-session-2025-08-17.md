# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Session
*Date: 2025-08-17*

## Objective
Implement role-based access control where only admin users can add tasks and perform administrative actions, while regular household members can see tasks, view task details, complete tasks, and assign tasks to themselves.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
✅ **Database Schema**: Complete role-based system already exists
- `household_members` table has `role` field with 'admin' and 'member' values
- RLS policies already differentiate between admin and member permissions
- Admin policies exist for task management operations

✅ **Authentication System**: Fully implemented
- `useAuth` hook provides user authentication
- `useHousehold` hook provides household context and `isAdmin` flag

✅ **Current Access Patterns**: Mixed implementation
- Some components check `isAdmin` but not consistently
- Task creation modal accessible to all users
- Need to add consistent role checks across UI components

### Database Permissions Analysis
Current RLS policies already implement proper role-based access:
- **Tasks**: Only admins can create/edit/delete (`role = 'admin'` in policies)
- **Task Assignments**: Admins can manage all, users can update their own
- **Task Completions**: Users can complete their own tasks, admins can approve/reject

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: UI Access Control Components

#### 1.1 Create Role Guard Components
- **Location**: `src/components/auth/`
- **Components**:
  - `AdminGuard.tsx` - Wraps admin-only features
  - `MemberGuard.tsx` - Wraps member-accessible features
  - `RoleBasedComponent.tsx` - Conditional rendering based on role

#### 1.2 Update Navigation & Layout
- **Location**: `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Hide "Add Task" button for non-admin users
  - Show different menu items based on role
  - Add role indicator in user profile area

### Phase 2: Task Management Access Control

#### 2.1 Task Creation Restrictions
- **Location**: `src/components/tasks/TaskManagement.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Hide "Add Task" button for non-admin users
  - Add role-based messaging for restricted features

#### 2.2 Task Actions Restrictions
- **Location**: `src/components/tasks/TaskTable.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Limit edit/delete actions to admin users only
  - Allow task assignment to self for all users
  - Allow task completion for all users

#### 2.3 Task Assignment Controls
- **Changes**:
  - Members can assign unassigned tasks to themselves
  - Members cannot reassign tasks to others
  - Admins have full assignment control

### Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience

#### 3.1 Role-Based Dashboard
- **Location**: `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Show different stats for admin vs member views
  - Admin: Full household overview, member management
  - Member: Personal task statistics, own progress

#### 3.2 Member-Specific Features
- **New Features**:
  - "Available Tasks" view for unassigned tasks
  - Personal task history and statistics
  - Task completion celebration focused on personal achievements

#### 3.3 Admin-Specific Features
- **New Features**:
  - Household member role management
  - Task approval/rejection interface
  - Household statistics and analytics

### Phase 4: Validation & Security

#### 4.1 Frontend Validation
- Add consistent role checks before API calls
- Implement proper error handling for unauthorized actions
- Add loading states for role-dependent features

#### 4.2 Database Policy Verification
- Verify existing RLS policies are sufficient
- Test edge cases for role-based access
- Ensure no privilege escalation vulnerabilities

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Role Guard Components
```typescript
// AdminGuard.tsx - Only render children for admin users
// MemberGuard.tsx - Only render children for regular members
// RoleBasedComponent.tsx - Render different content based on role
```

### Step 2: Update Task Management UI
```typescript
// TaskManagement.tsx
- Wrap "Add Task" button in AdminGuard
- Add member-friendly messaging
- Show "Available Tasks" section for members

// TaskTable.tsx  
- Conditional action buttons based on role
- Self-assignment feature for members
- Admin-only edit/delete actions
```

### Step 3: Enhance Member Experience
```typescript
// Add components:
- AvailableTasksView.tsx
- PersonalTaskStats.tsx
- TaskSelfAssignment.tsx
```

### Step 4: Enhance Admin Experience
```typescript
// Add components:
- HouseholdMemberManagement.tsx
- TaskApprovalInterface.tsx
- AdminDashboard.tsx
```

### Step 5: Update Navigation
```typescript
// Sidebar.tsx
- Role-based menu items
- Admin/Member status indicator
- Different quick actions based on role
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Create Role Guard Components** (30 min)
2. **Update Task Management UI** (45 min)
3. **Implement Member Features** (60 min)
4. **Implement Admin Features** (45 min)
5. **Update Navigation** (30 min)
6. **Testing & Validation** (30 min)

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- Role checks are UI-only; all security enforced at database level
- Graceful degradation when role changes during session
- Clear user feedback for restricted actions

### Backend Security
- Existing RLS policies provide robust protection
- No additional database changes required
- Database enforces all access control rules

## User Experience Flow

### Admin User Journey
1. Login → See full dashboard with household overview
2. Access task management with full CRUD operations
3. Manage household members and their roles
4. Approve/reject task completions
5. View comprehensive analytics

### Member User Journey
1. Login → See personal dashboard with own tasks
2. View available unassigned tasks
3. Assign tasks to self from available pool
4. Complete assigned tasks with proof submission
5. Track personal progress and achievements

## Success Criteria

✅ **Functional**:
- Admin users can create/edit/delete tasks
- Members can only view and self-assign tasks
- Task completion works for all users
- Role-based UI properly hides/shows features

✅ **Security**:
- No unauthorized API access possible
- Database policies enforce all restrictions
- Frontend gracefully handles role changes

✅ **User Experience**:
- Clear role indicators in UI
- Appropriate messaging for restricted features
- Smooth workflow for both user types

## Post-Implementation Enhancements
- Role-based notifications
- Member request system for new tasks
- Temporary role elevation for special cases
- Audit logging for admin actions
