# Project: Gamified Household Task Management Web Application

### **Overview**
Build a full-stack web application that helps households manage and distribute daily chores through gamification mechanics. The app should motivate family members/roommates to complete tasks by incorporating points, achievements, and friendly competition.

### **Core Features & Requirements**

#### **1. Authentication & User Management**
- User registration with email/password
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- User profiles with avatars and display names

#### **2. Household Management**
- **Create Household**: Users can create a new household with a name and optional description
- **Join Household**: Users can join existing households via invite code or link
- **Roles**: 
  - Admin (household creator): Full permissions
  - Member: Can complete tasks, view schedules, earn points
- **Member Management**: Admins can invite, remove, or modify member permissions

#### **3. Task/Duty System**
Tasks should have the following properties:
- **Name & Description**: Clear task identification
- **Category**: (Cleaning, Cooking, Laundry, Shopping, Maintenance, etc.)
- **Recurrence Pattern**: 
  - One-time
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly
  - Custom schedule (e.g., every 3 days, specific days of week)
- **Time Properties**:
  - Estimated duration
  - Deadline/due time
  - Time window (e.g., morning, evening, anytime)
- **Difficulty Level**: Easy/Medium/Hard (affects point value)
- **Point Value**: Base reward for completion
- **Assignment Type**: 
  - Fixed (always assigned to specific person)
  - Rotating (cycles through members)
  - Flexible (anyone can claim)

#### **4. Task Distribution & Assignment**
- **Manual Assignment**: Admin assigns tasks to specific members
- **Auto-Distribution**: "Distribute Evenly" algorithm that considers:
  - Member availability
  - Current task load
  - Task history (to ensure variety)
  - Member preferences/restrictions
- **Task Trading**: Members can request to swap tasks
- **Task Claiming**: For unassigned tasks, members can volunteer

#### **5. Dashboard Views**
Main dashboard should display:
- **Personal Stats**: Points, streak, completed tasks today
- **Quick Actions**: Mark task complete, view upcoming tasks
- **Household Overview**: Total tasks completed, leaderboard preview
- **Notifications**: Task reminders, approval requests, household updates

#### **6. Calendar View**
- **View Modes**: 
  - Day view (detailed timeline)
  - Week view (7-day grid)
  - Month view (traditional calendar)
- **Filters**:
  - By member (show only specific person's tasks)
  - By status (completed/pending/overdue)
  - By category
  - By date range
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Color coding by category or member
  - Status badges (completed, pending approval, overdue)
  - Progress bars for partially completed recurring tasks

#### **7. Task Completion Flow**
When marking a task complete:
- **Completion Form**:
  - Status toggle (complete/incomplete)
  - Optional notes/summary (text field)
  - Proof attachment (photo/video upload - optional)
  - Time spent (auto-tracked or manual entry)
  - Difficulty feedback (was it harder/easier than expected?)
- **Approval Process**:
  - Tasks requiring approval go to admin queue
  - Admin can approve/reject with feedback
  - Points awarded upon approval

#### **8. Gamification Elements**
- **Points System**:
  - Base points per task
  - Bonus points for streaks
  - Multipliers for difficulty
  - Deductions for late completion
- **Achievements/Badges**:
  - "7-Day Streak"
  - "Early Bird" (completing morning tasks)
  - "Jack of All Trades" (completing various categories)
  - Custom household achievements
- **Leaderboard**:
  - Weekly/Monthly/All-time rankings
  - Points and tasks completed
  - Streak counters
- **Levels/Ranks**: Progressive titles based on total points
- **Rewards System**: Admins can set real-world rewards for point milestones

#### **9. Notifications & Reminders**
- Task due soon (customizable timing)
- Task overdue alerts
- New task assigned
- Task approval requests
- Household announcements
- Achievement unlocked

### **Technical Specifications**

#### **Frontend Requirements**
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Modern, clean UI with clear visual hierarchy
- Interactive calendar component
- Drag-and-drop for task management
- Real-time updates (websockets or polling)
- Progress animations and micro-interactions
- Dark/light theme toggle

#### **Backend Requirements**
- RESTful API or GraphQL
- User authentication (JWT or session-based)
- File upload handling for proof attachments
- Scheduled job system for recurring tasks and notifications
- Data validation and error handling

#### **Database Schema Considerations**
Key entities to model:
- Users
- Households
- Tasks (with recurrence rules)
- Task Assignments
- Task Completions
- Points/Achievements
- Notifications
- Household Invitations

### **User Journey Example**
1. **Sarah creates account** → Sees welcome screen
2. **Creates household** "The Smith Family"
3. **Sets up common tasks**:
   - "Kitchen Cleanup" - Daily, 30 min, 50 points
   - "Laundry" - Every 3 days, 1 hour, 75 points
   - "Grocery Shopping" - Weekly, 2 hours, 100 points
4. **Invites family members** via email/link
5. **Configures distribution** → Chooses "auto-distribute evenly"
6. **Family members join** → See their assigned tasks
7. **Daily use**: Members check dashboard, complete tasks, earn points
8. **Sarah reviews** completed tasks, approves them, views leaderboard
9. **End of month**: Rewards given based on point totals

### **Additional Considerations**
- Privacy settings for household data
- Export functionality for task history
- Mobile app potential (PWA or native)
- Integration possibilities (Google Calendar, Slack, etc.)
- Accessibility features (WCAG compliance)
- Multi-language support
- Timezone handling for distributed households

### **Success Metrics**
The app should effectively:
- Reduce household friction around chore distribution
- Increase task completion rates through gamification
- Provide clear visibility into household responsibilities
- Make chore management engaging rather than tedious
